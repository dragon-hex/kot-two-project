# Disclaimer!

This project is not finished, this is just the barebones or sketch!

**THIS IS NOT THE FINAL PROJECT!**

There is a lot of useless code and things that need to be changed.

# Project Kot2
Kot2 is a engine based on RPG maker and others of the genre.
This is the future Pet Quest engine.

It features:
1. Mostly of the "maps" and "actions" are written in JSON.
2. Internal Commands.

# Future Versions
For future versions, there will be a fully functional map editor and some other stuff.

For example:
1. A Cool Scripting Language (coming soon).
2. Infinite Map Size
3. More functions and commands.

# More information

Kot2 is written in Python 3.X, it can run on:
* Windows
* Linux
* And any other platform that supports Pygame and Python 3.X

We have plans to re-write Kot2 to Kot3 but on C++ but on a very distant future ðŸ˜†
